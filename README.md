# Frequentist_Statistics_mini_projects
This was done as a part of Springboard Data Science Career Track course (Unit8.1.3. Frequentist Statistics).  

The following list includes the topics:

- the z-statistic
- the t-statistic
- the difference and relationship between the two
- the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences
- how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample
- the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean
- how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval and p-values
- how those confidence intervals and p-values are used to perform hypothesis tests
